# Dotfiles

This repository is a collection of my configuration files for Arch Linux, that may or 
may not work on other Linux distributions.

I prefer using [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html)
to auto symlink my configurations, but none of these configurations are tightly
coupled with either `home-manager` or `nix` as a whole, except the shell loading
some environment variables here and there.
